Desktop application for a store management system. Connects to local MySQL database. Project has since been converted to connect with MongoDB if needed.

This system provides the following main functions for its users:

1. Add and update information for customers, suppliers, products available for sale in the store.

2. Add and update information for orders and payments.

3. Generate sale reports. The user can save a sale report as a text file. There should be at least three forms of sale reports: i) total sale per month in a given time period; ii) total sale per product in a given time period; and iii) total sale per customer in a given time period. There is an option to sort the sale descending or cut off. For example, report only top 100 products with highest total sale.
